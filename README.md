# Password Strength Evaluation

## Objective
To evaluate how password complexity affects security using password strength checkers.

## Tools Used
- Online Password Strength Checker (free tools)
- Text editor
- Spreadsheet tool

## Methodology
1. Created passwords with different complexity levels.
2. Tested each password using strength checker.
3. Recorded scores and feedback.
4. Studied common password attacks.
5. Analyzed how complexity improves security.

## Outcome
The experiment showed that longer, complex, and random passwords are significantly more secure and resistant to attacks.
