# Common Password Attacks

## Brute Force Attack
Attempts all possible combinations until the correct password is found.
Short and simple passwords are easily cracked.

## Dictionary Attack
Uses common words and leaked passwords.
Passwords like "admin" and "password123" fail instantly.

Password reuse increases risk.

## Rainbow Table Attack

Salted and complex passwords resist this.
